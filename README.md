# CarDamageDetection
## Context
This project aims to revolutionize the assessment and analysis of damaged cars through cutting-edge deep learning and computer vision techniques. It encompasses multiple modules, each addressing a crucial aspect of the overall evaluation process. By utilizing this platform, you will be able to detect whether an image of a damaged car is generated by artificial intelligence, ensuring the reliability of the input data. Moving forward, you can classify the severity of car damage into low, medium, or severe categories, providing a comprehensive understanding of the extent of the impairment. The platform also goes a step further by identifying the specific parts of the car that are damaged, contributing to a detailed analysis. Additionally, it takes on the task of segmenting and quantifying the cost of repairing the identified damages, offering valuable insights for repair estimation. The holistic approach of this project aims to advance the field of car damage assessment.
